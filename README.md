# Fridge Controller

Secop BD35F fridge compressor speed controller integration with Dometic RML10 series absorption refirgerator.

After retrofitting my Dometic RML10 absorption RV refrigerator with a Secop BD35F 12V compressor unit, I needed to implement a control unit to address the following issues:

* The compressor unit utilizes the RML10's built-in thermostat and is activated by setting the fridge to 12V mode. It operates using the output originally intended for the 12V heating unit it replaced. However, since the thermostat was designed for an absorption unit, it has a very narrow hysteresis, causing the compressor to cycle on and off too frequently.

* The BD35F compressorâ€™s electronic control unit supports variable speed control, either by installing a coding resistor in series with the thermostat or by using a PWM signal to regulate the speed.

The controller in this project is positioned between the RML10 output, which controls the 12V heater relay, and the BD35F thermostat input. It minimizes frequent compressor cycling by enforcing configurable minimum on and off durations.

Moreover, the controller dynamically adjusts the PWM signal that regulates the compressor's RPM. It continuously monitors the compressor's on and off durations. If the on duration surpasses a specific threshold, the controller gradually increases the compressor speed. Conversely, if the off duration exceeds a certain threshold, the controller gradually reduces the compressor speed.

## Notes

The code has been implemented and tested on an Arduino Pro Mini clone board based on the ATmega328P microcontroller.

This project uses Git submodules. In order to get its full source code, please clone this Git repository to your local workspace, then execute the follwoing command from within the repository's root directory: `git submodule update --init`.

The following dependencies should to be installed:

* `pip install pyserial`

This project can be compiled from command line using a makefile. Following are the available make commands:

* Compile the project: `make`
* Remove compiled artefacts: `make clean`
* Upload to Arduino board: `make upload`
* To generate the release archive: `make release`

Prior to uploading the firmware, please ensure that the following parameaters are configured correctly in `Makefile`:

* `BOARD_TAG`: Device type as listed in `boards.txt` or `make show_boards` (e.g.: pro, uno).
* `BOARD_SUB`: Submenu as listed in `boards.txt` or `make show_submenu` (e.g.: 16MHzatmega328, atmega168)
* `MONITOR_BAUDRATE`: Serial port Baud rate (possible values: 4800, 9600, 14400, 19200, 28800, 38400, 57600, 115200)
* `MONITOR_PORT`: Serial port device (e.g.: /dev/tty.usbserial-00000000)

For more information, please refer to [the Arduino-Makefile documentation](arduino-mk/arduino-mk-vars.md).

<!--
This project is configured for using the clangd VSCode plugin for code indexing. In order to use the clangd plugin, `compile_commands.json` file needs to be generated. This file is already part of the rpository, however it needs to be regenerated if new source files have been added to the project. The generation of `compile_commands.json` has been performed using the `compileddb` Python tool (`pip install compiledb`, https://pypi.org/project/compiledb/). The generation is performd using the following command: `compiledb make`.
